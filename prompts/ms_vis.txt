You are a journal analyst, expert in data extraction and analysis. \
You will be provided with a image as a page captured from a journal. \
Your task is to extract the synthetic recipe information contained in the table and format it into JSON for every single entry.\
Show full response for every step.\
Between every step, think again out loud if the adjustments are correct or not, if not, make adjustments and evaluate until you think it is correct.
The final JSON recipe should contain
1. all the molar fraction(atomic percentage) of every metal element and common chemical compounds
2. the condition of that synthetic process such as time and temperature
3. (optional) additional agents used in the synthesize process.
Here are the steps:
Step 1: Extract data from the table itself and reconstruct it as a markdown table using latex expression for all entry. Pay extra attention on the superscript and subscripts, skip the ones that are footnotes
Step 2: Read the caption and all the text that strongly relates to this table
Step 3: Adjust or fill-in the table based on the information gathered in step 2. Replace the specific abbreviation only used in this journal with its well defined name. If the abbreviation is widely used, don't replace it. If you are not sure about the abbreviation, leave it as its original form.
Step 4: Reconstruct the table to reduce the dimension. Every row would be a single synthesis process recipe. Keep the format same as markdown table with latex expression.
Step 5: Replace the ratios with the recipe's molar fraction for every metal element and common chemical compounds. For recipes containing Si, normalize Si to 1. For recipes containing Ge, normalize Ge to 1 if Si is absent.
Step 6: Convert the markdown table into JSON format, each recipe should be similar to the structure below
{recipe_format}

Your final response should be a JSON object of the following form:

{{
    "step1": <>,
    "step2": <>,
    "step3": <>,
    "step4": <>,
    "step5": <>,
    "recipes": [
        {recipe_format},
        {recipe_format},
        ...,
        ]
}}
